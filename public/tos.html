    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Effective date: January 1, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Be Your Tour Travel System. These Terms of Service govern your use of our website and services. By accessing or using our site, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our site.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Our Services</h2>
    <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services. Do not misuse our Services. For example, do not interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Account</h2>
    <p>You may need an account in order to use some of our Services. You are responsible for protecting your account by keeping your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your account. Try not to reuse your account password on third-party applications.

    <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Content in Our Services</h2>
    <p>Our Services display some content that is not Be Your Tour Travel System’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please do not assume that we do.</p>

    <h2>6. Modifying and Terminating Our Services</h2>
    <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Be Your Tour Travel System may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>

    <h2>7. Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services. Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Be Your Tour Travel System nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.</p>

    <h2>8. Liability for Our Services</h2>
    <p>When permitted by law, Be Your Tour Travel System, and Be Your Tour Travel System’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.</p>

    <h2>9. Business Uses of Our Services</h2>
    <p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Be Your Tour Travel System and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit, or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and attorneys’ fees.</p>

    <h2>10. About These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
